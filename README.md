# mock-status-menu

created to test out using a subtree repo (this one) as part of several static sites operated by status.

The goal is that this repo would contain some partials (header and footer menus). Ideally style and JS should be part of this repo and therefor not duplicated in the 'parent' repos (static sites) that will make use of this menu.
